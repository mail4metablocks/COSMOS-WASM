# COSMOS-WASM

COSMOS WASM (COSMWASM) is a WebAssembly (WASM) interpreter that can be used to execute smart contracts on the Cosmos blockchain. WASM is a low-level, portable binary format that can be used to run code on a variety of platforms, including web browsers, servers, and embedded devices. By using WASM, developers can write smart contracts in a variety of languages, including C, C++, Rust, and others, and have them run on the Cosmos blockchain.

COSMWASM is implemented in Go and is designed to be used in conjunction with the Cosmos SDK, a framework for building blockchains and applications on the Cosmos network. It provides developers with the tools and resources needed to build decentralized applications (DApps) that can interact with the Cosmos blockchain and take advantage of its features, such as fast transaction speeds, low fees, and high scalability.
